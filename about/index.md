I'm Srijan R Shetty, a senior undergraduate in the <a href="http://cse.iitk.ac.in">Department of Computer
Science and Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://iitk.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology</a>. I'm humbled
that you consider me worthy of your valuable time and ergo I'm obliged to introduce myself.

I'm and eccentric who like to scribble and <a href="https://github.com/srijanshety">hack on</a> things
(note the 'on'). I like writing poems, the occasional <a href="https://srijanshetty.quora.com/Open-letter-to-the-Senators">
open letters in the wild</a> and rants.

I was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=464046796623&set=t.100000238480290&type=3&theater">fat</a>
, I'm <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=446458752038737&set=a.152928964725052.29764.100000238480290&type=1&theater">not-so-fat now</a>. I managed to crack (sic) IITJEE, and they had to find a
replacement for it next year. To the surprise of all the aunties of my neighbourhood, I chose Kanpur over Bombay.
(<a href="https://srijanshetty.quora.com/Why-IIT-Kanpur">best-decision-of-my-life</a>).
In college, I renounced all earthly concerns and joined the peace corps of <a href="http://antaragni.org">Antaragni</a>,
and dedicated my college-life to the well being of juniors.

I fancy myself as a Pan-Indian. My parents are from the South, this allows me to be an elitist South Indian,
doling out free advice (being an IITian is the icing on the cake). Being brought up in North India allows me
to enjoy Yo Yo Honey Singh without any baggage.

My handle is srijanshetty on most sites. You should follow me on <a href="https://github.com/srijanshetty">GitHub</a>.
