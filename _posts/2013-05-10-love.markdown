Moon and stars a union delight,<br/>
The two meet in this heavenly sight;<br/>
He falls to Venus' might<br/>
While she is nescient of his plight.<br/><br/>
The spell is cast, a story starts,<br/>
He yearns for her heart;<br/>
yet his love, his precious,<br/>
remains forever oblivious.<br/><br/>
He expresses his love, but in vain,<br/>
For she misunderstands - its his bane;<br/>
The world mocks him insane,<br/>
But only a few understand his pain.<br/>
Despite the anguish, he remains persistent,<br/>
and the unrelenting gods remain adamant.<br/><br/>
Despite his wretched fate,<br/>
nothing but her will satiate<br/>
his implacable thirst,<br/>
as she is his only and first.<br/>
Ergo he wont give up, he will fight,<br/>
for he believes his love is right.<br/><br/>
