> Two roads diverged in a wood, and estranged they stood.

For a minute there I wanted time to stop,<br>
A thousand answers whirred by,<br>
With no semblance to the question at top.<br><br>
Words felt heavy, and my breath was lost,<br>
A wandering spirit, a guilt, and a rumour of loss,<br>
Not reason, it was absolution I sought.<br><br>
We had trudged along, enduring our plight,<br>
Numbed by our pain, seeking respite,<br>
Dreaming together, in the search of light.<br><br>
No direction, and this inheritance of loss,<br>
In our love of shared pain, and lost cause,<br>
Being alone, with each other, in this chaos.<br><br>
Yes, I'd erred, I had lost her hand,<br>
Not knowing what that had meant,<br>
I'm now left with ruins in the sand.<br><br>
These echoes of silence, my hopeless cries,<br>
Hallow my way - the scars of a past life,<br>
Guiding my path, amidst these many lies.<br><br>
The minute was gone, the thought was spent,<br>
And even if I yearned, or asked for more,<br>
The deed was done, no wise of what it meant.<br><br>
