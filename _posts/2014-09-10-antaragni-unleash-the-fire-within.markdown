> A little poem I wrote in January, while preparing for the Core Team interviews; the time seems apt to release it.

The legend exists since the times of yore:<br>
In the uncharted territories of Cawnpore,<br>
Was a mythical flame powerful and old,<br>
With a destiny the fates had already foretold,<br>
Every year in the grand carnival of fall,<br>
where victors and vanquished, both stood tall,<br>
The flame would unleash, it would consume all,<br>
And transcend their spirits to the immortal Gods.<br>
