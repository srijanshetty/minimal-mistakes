Hi, "I'm the other Srijan, the one not from Devfolio" was the byline I've been forced to use for the past two months as
a certain [srijan](https://twitter.com/srijancse) has monopolized the byline. Yes, it was ardous but at the same time it
was incredibly fun and that line is probably a concise description of everything I was upto at the
[0xPolygon](https://twitter.com/0xPolygon) x [devfolio](https://twitter.com/devfolio) Fellowship.<br/><br/>
I'll be honest, it wasn't easy being the amongst the oldest of the lot in a hackerhouse and I'd be lying if I said that
my age represented the age old wisdom of experience. The fellowship was replete with build00rs of all ages, and every
minute was spent learning about the amazing ideas that the fellows were working on - from DeFi yield farming to the
beauties of Account Abstraction, and ingeniuty of MeV searchers. The countless hours discussing the frontier of web3 and
hacking along with the best of the build00rs of ecosystem is time that I shall definitely cherish.<br/><br/>
My idea for the fellowship was to try and solve the problem of decentralized hiring through
[Trinity](https://bytrinity.xyz). Hiring is a broken process and it leaves no one happy. Potential candidates are
optimizing for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), while employers are unable to come up with a comprehensive solution
to test the technical skills of the candidates without any Proof Of Work (PoW). Trinity tries to solve this problem
using a novel approach of adding a layer of validators who conduct technical interviews of the candidates and provide
them with skill NFTs (now and Soul Bound Tokens) later to solve the cold-start problem of hiring. If a candidate gets
hired, the validators earn a small comission from the employer.<br/><br/>
