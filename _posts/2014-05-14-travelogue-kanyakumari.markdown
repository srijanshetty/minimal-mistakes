And the winds blew,
Cleansing my head of,
Dreams I had construe.<br/></br>
And in the blue sea quaint,
I found no expectations to fulfill,
All purposes seemed faint.<br/></br>
The rock stood glistening,
Unscathed by time; stoic;
Years of mute listening.<br/></br>
The blue sky dappled indigo,
Vibrant; Couldn't care less;
Of the many things I let go.<br/></br>
These valleys, the sea,
Mocked the futility life,
Of aspirations to be.<br/></br>
Are we near light?
Or are those goals still,
Looming in sight?
