Those ghastly shadows,<br/>
The evils of my kin,<br/>
Those sickening gallows,<br/>
The penitence of my sin.<br/><br/>
A painful sorrow,<br/>
And a yesterday beset,<br/>
A new tomorrow,<br/>
With burdens to forget.<br/><br/>
A haunted past,<br/>
A life that had been,<br/>
Purgation at last,<br/>
For the demons within.<br/><br/>
