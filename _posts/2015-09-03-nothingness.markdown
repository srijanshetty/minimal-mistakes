> An attempt at free verse.

The light at the end of the tunnel,<br>
Unrequited hope and unending faith -<br>
All artifacts of our weak minds,<br>
Desperate cries of pitiful hearts.<br><br>
We crave endings, seek meanings,<br>
For we don't want, we can't bear,<br>
The dark reality, the sad tragedy,<br>
Of living without consequence,<br>
Of dying without resurgence.<br><br>
Hell and heaven were never the artifacts of religion,<br>
They've been our inability to reconcile nothingness.<br>
