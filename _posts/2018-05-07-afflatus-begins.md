I would be lying to you if I told you that this is the first time I've tried to pen down this particular post. The idea of this blog post has existed for quite some time; but each half baked attempt has ended up in the bottomless pit of my unpublished ramblings.

Alas, life is transitory and I've decided that I no longer will seek absolution in my words. That hope is forlorn.

The modus operandi of this blog will be simple. At times, I intend to present coherent arguments for both sides of a debate; but mostly, it’ll be excerpts and ramblings from a mind addled by a quarter life crisis. Or it'll be a technical post, to keep all things balanced.

So, let’s hope that the afflatus stays for long. If not, the depression of social media would be my only recourse.
