Wisps of smoke, and a floor cold,<br/>
A broken pavement, centuries old.<br/>
The refuge of wanderers left astray,<br/>
Seeped in our culture - dying today.<br/><br/>
As the sun kissed the horizon, men poured in,<br/>
Masters once of a habit that pulled them in,<br/>
A curt nod, pleasantries were exchanged,<br/>
All the same, the homeless and estranged.<br/>
Lives intertwined, tales shared,<br/>
Love, grudges - nothing spared.<br/>
Faces of men old and new,<br/>
Friends, who I hardly knew.<br/><br/>
And as words became muffled,<br/>
And the light in my hands lost,<br/>
We rose to leave, only to return.<br/>
