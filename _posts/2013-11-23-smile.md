What's in my smile she asked,<br/>
And I was at loss of words.<br/><br/>
Not at her question but her naivety;<br/>
for she simply couldn't see,<br/>
what I saw - her simplicity, her beauty.<br/>
So, I stood there staring in those,<br/>
starry eyes, as her lips quivered,<br/>
crimson as that unfaithful rose.<br/>
I could give those hopeful eyes,<br/>
the world, the universe, but words,<br/>
to them would be disgrace - lies.<br/><br/>
And so, all I could say was this:<br/>
When all hope seems weak,<br/>
It's your reassuring smile; I miss.<br/>
When I'm lost amidst these men,<br/>
It's your familiar voice, your<br/>
beautiful embrace, I desire then.<br/>
And when dusk draws near,<br/>
It's that ever so familiar light,<br/>
I search and seek for my dear.<br/><br/>
In the end it's not the question,<br/>
But the fact that I'm such a wreck -<br/>
that the girl whose possession,<br/>
Is this marvel, would never learn it's<br/>
wonder, for I'll remain in the shadows; gutless,<br/>
with a pen, tearing this verse to bits.<br/>
