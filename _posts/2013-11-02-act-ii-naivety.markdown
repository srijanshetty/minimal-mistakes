To the court came a nobleman wise and old,<br/>
The founder of an army new and bold,<br/>
With a plea against the law that forbid,<br/>
The captain of a platoon to be an old lead.<br/>
The King confused, asked his army chief,<br/>
But the court was hesitant to turn a new leaf,<br/>
Seeing the his plight, our man,<br/>
A kind heart, thought of a plan,<br/>
He took the reins of the nascent Legion,<br/>
Only in name, for it was a dangerous region.<br/>
Alas, his fate! As they mistook,<br/>
A selfless act; spare not a queen nor rook.<br/>
He stood wronged again, for the lack of wits,<br/>
Another noble act, shredded to bits.<br/><br/>
