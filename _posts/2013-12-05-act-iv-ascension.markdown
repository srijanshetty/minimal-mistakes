Our man, with his wretched fate;<br/>
a destiny with only miseries to date;<br/>
memories he couldn't face,<br/>
was broken - sought solace.<br/><br/>
Ergo he chose to recede - to fade away,<br/>
and time passed slowly, until one day:<br/>
He chanced upon a legion great,<br/>
(A legion intertwined with his fate).<br/>
The legion of fire, not very old,<br/>
Borne by men strong and bold.<br/><br/>
Our man blissfully unaware,<br/>
Had no clue as to where,<br/>
His life was headed, took a leap,<br/>
To forge a tale, centuries would keep.<br/><br/>
Where once was loss, now was desire,<br/>
Where once was fear, now was  a fire.<br/>
He joined the legion not to lead those men,<br/>
To redeem, but who could have thought then,<br/>
That our man with his fellow generals humble,<br/>
Would pull of a historic win, a huge gamble.<br/><br/>
And so he saw hope, his faith did return,<br/>
The legion was a spark, for fates did turn.<br/><br/>
