As fear crippled my thoughts,<br/>
I could see an impending doom.<br/>
Not the valley that lay ahead,<br/>
An irrational fear did consume.<br/><br/>
As the ledge came to an end,<br/>
My heart swelled with hope,<br/>
Of living a brighter tomorrow,<br/>
Not constrained by this rope.<br/><br/>
So, I took the leap of faith,<br/>
To my friends echoing my name.<br/>
And in those few seconds I knew,<br/>
Life would never be the same.<br/>
