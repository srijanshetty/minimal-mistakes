[Fuze](https://fuze.finance) was built on a completely different mindset than
[allround](https://allroundclub.com).<br/><br/>
With allround, I was trying to maximise the expected outcome in life.<br/><br/>
With Fuze, I just wanted to enjoy the process of building something that scales and serves thousands if not millions of people, while working with a cracked team that loves the process.<br/><br/>
During my sabbatical, a hard realisation that hit me was that I might not be the best person to start a consumer company. Maybe one day, but not yet.<br/><br/>
I read this piece by Richard Feynman on finding joy in work to deal with burnout and this inspired me a lot: [on burnout](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/kilcup.1/262/feynman.html). Echoing Mr. Feynman's sentiment, I wanted to work on something that was 'fun' and I would look forward to everyday.</br/><br/>
The summer of 2022, was spent tinkering with the cool folks at [Superteam](https://superteam.fun/). Working with chad folks and cracked devs, I imbibed the Solana ethos. It was during this time that my conviction on building on crypto solidified.<br/><br/>
In 2022 at the Solana Hacker House Mumbai I spoke about how 'Stablecoins are the killer use-case of crypto' and today they've taken over the finance world by storm.<br/><br/>
Crypto through stablecoins provides the first time to rewrite the banking stack with an internet first primitive. Open banking, FinTechs were a layer on top of core banking systems. But stablecoins is an innovation that is outside in is already having far reaching impact.<br/><br/>
The crypto ethos, the belief that stablecoin will eat the world, and the need to build a place where you can have fun building a system that scales to millions are few of the driving forces for me personally.
