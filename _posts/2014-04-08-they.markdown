He was never content, he wanted more,<br/>
Every time they met a new face she wore.<br/>
He was assiduous, he could not waste time,<br/>
Whenever they met, she silently stopped time.<br/><br/>
He lived in the moment, he had no regrets,<br/>
With him she didn't think, there were no bets.<br/>
He was eccentric, he could not decide,<br/>
She was the wind that flew with his mind.<br/><br/>
He was ostentatious, he liked the lime light,<br/>
She couldn't care less, gave it without a fight.<br/>
He was restless, he hated to sleep,<br/>
With her he had no promises to keep.<br/><br/>
She had a past she couldn't let go,<br/>
His past he hid, no one could know.<br/>
A future she couldn't stop thinking about,<br/>
A thing he preferred being oblivious about.<br/><br/>
She was oblivious of her beauty,<br/>
And he adored her simplicity,<br/>
She always wanted more of his time,<br/>
He would coerce her with his rhyme.<br/><br/>
She wasn't your typical mushy lady,<br/>
She took both those imposters in stride,<br/>
He wasn't your typical uptight man,<br/>
He had more than a false pride.<br/><br/>
Everything about them seemed odd,<br/>
And despite all of this, they stand -<br/>
this enigmatic pair,  undiscerning,<br/>
Amidst differences, hand in hand.<br/></br>
