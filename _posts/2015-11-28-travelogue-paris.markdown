Alas there were more than two,<br/>
A beautiful maid - male a few.<br/>
Willing caught in this deja - vu,<br/>
the young lad; his story anew,<br/>
still at odds in the battle of two.<br/>
Lest he was cursed, it had to be;<br/>
The one scarred - couldn't see.<br/>
It stirred, the dove was set free;<br/>
stoic his aide, oblivion enemy,<br/>
the vanguard so took his stride,<br/>
a sullen brow, a callous hide,<br/>
a tale to tell, a pen to confide.<br/>
