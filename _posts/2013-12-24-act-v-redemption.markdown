As the prince's ambition grew, a plan was hatched,<br/>
Kill the prodigal son, the moment should be snatched,<br/>
The plan saw light, a denunciation was sent,<br/>
A court was summoned, with a judge bent,<br/>
Knowing full well his act of sin,<br/>
the prince knew he couldn't win,<br/>
He pleaded to the kingpin,<br/>
and thereby save his from a future grim,<br/>
The conspiracy pulled through, the prince was an easy kill,<br/>
But little did they know that their plan would go uphill,<br/>
For while they rejoiced over a deed well done,<br/>
The King's bastard, a younger son,<br/>
Seized the moment, took his kins place,<br/>
This filthy scum, a royal disgrace,<br/>
A cunning fox, had to be replaced,<br/>
Realizing their folly, a call was placed,<br/>
For men who could rise,<br/>
and be their weapon in disguise,<br/>
So our man was to be summoned, to fight this vice,<br/>
He in his political exile, commanded the Legion of flames,<br/>
He was taken by surprise , as the men with no names,<br/>
Our man obliged for the lack of choice,<br/>
The inviting party gave with their deceiving lies,<br/>
Through the raging storm they reached to where it all began,<br/>
Those old courts, the King's throne, the denounced life of our man.<br/>
He knew full well of the new prince, a good friend, a fellow flame,<br/>
Our man confessed, the prince's ascent,  was his to blame,<br/>
He refused to help, for the courts mess was not his to clean,<br/>
For the Legion was his future, this was what he had been.<br/>
And he walked away, wronged again,<br/>
A story unheard, a sacrifice in vain.<br/>
For the world believed he was never the man I knew,<br/>
A figment of greatness that I construe.<br/>
