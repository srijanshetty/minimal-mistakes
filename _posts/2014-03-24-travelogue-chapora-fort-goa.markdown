The shore was calm, the winds silently blew,<br/>
Memories rushed by, and a grin silently grew.<br/></br/>
Myriad streams inched ahead relentlessly,<br/>
And random thoughts crossed by aimlessly.<br/>
There were no thoughts in particular,<br/>
The waves splashed around in a blur.<br/><br/>
Vignettes of what had once been,<br/>
Pebbles that would later gleam.<br/>
Apprehensions about times yet to come,<br/>
Wafts of water evaporated by the sun.<br/><br/>
His mind was lost to the waters iridescent,<br/>
Events had transpired, the air smelt different.<br/>
It was hard to believe how life had turned,<br/>
He was far ahead from the last he burned.<br/><br/>
And as a maroon spread in the sky,<br/>
He realised it's time for good bye,<br/>
He picked his satchel, stole one last glance,<br/>
Savoured a view that had come by chance,<br/>
And then he went in a direction new,<br/>
Never to look back at those waters blue.<br/><br/>
