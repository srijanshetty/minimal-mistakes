> This is one of my favourite works, for every verse reminds me of a chapter in my life.

Sometimes tears quench the pain,<br/>
Sometimes a loss has more to gain,<br/>
Sometimes words are not enough,<br/>
Sometimes life is agonizingly tough,<br/>
Sometimes you can only believe,<br/>
Sometimes friends do betray and deceive,<br/>
Sometimes old foes become friends,<br/>
Sometimes a battle never ends,<br/>
Sometimes expectations don't matter,<br/>
Sometimes dreams do shatter,<br/>
Sometimes you are left estranged,<br/>
Sometimes the person in the mirror has changed.<br/>
Sometimes people act uncanny and strange,<br/>
Sometimes silence drives you insane,<br/>
Sometimes your best efforts are in vain.<br/><br/>
Sometimes the most certain thing in life,<br/>
Becomes its greatest strife;<br/>
Sometimes the mistakes that you do,<br/>
Outlives the good in you.<br/>
Sometimes after all is said and done,<br/>
You still fail to recognize 'the one'.<br/>
