It's the search of greener pastures,<br>
The fear of these barren lands,<br>
The tireless flow of currents,<br>
The fear of being left ashore.<br/><br/>
The pursuit of infinity,<br>
The fear of being average.<br>
The search of Neverland,<br>
Lest you remain anchored.<br/><br/>
Fuels an eclectic passion,<br>
A desire to transcend,<br>
To nourish, to create,<br>
To leave, and to move.<br>
