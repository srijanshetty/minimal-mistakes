It's the search of greener pastures,
The fear of these barren lands,
The tireless flow of currents,
The fear of being left ashore.<br/><br/>
The pursuit of infinity,
The fear of being average.
The search of Neverland,
Lest you remain anchored.<br/><br/>
Fuels an eclectic passion,
A desire to transcend,
To nourish, to create,
To leave, and to move.
