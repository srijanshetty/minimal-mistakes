Goodbyes are hard, and seldom perfect, especially when humdrum lives that lay ahead sink in. Standing at the prow of the cruise basking in the millions lights of Moscow, I felt debilitated by reality - these ten days were whimsical, yet I felt it slipping away and the harder I tried to capture it, the faster it slipped. In our foolhardy attempts to capture the moment, we've forgotten how to live them. Not everything needs the testimony of a photograph, not every memory needs to be validation of your fraternity. Some moments are inexorably lived then and there and left to the agency of the human mind. And so I let myself go, emboldened by the wine, I let the warmth of my friends sink in to the bittersweet symphony of endings.
