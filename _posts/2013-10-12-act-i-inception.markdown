>In the coming six to seven acts, I shall try to narrate a story which is very close to my heart and has been veiled in allegory. (This is my first attempt at poetic prose, so please bear with me)

A lot has been talked about,<br/>
Feelings have been let out,<br/>
Of exploits of a man I knew,<br/>
Of glories they say he construe.<br/>
But there's more than what meets the eye,<br/>
For not every story was an illustrious lie.<br/><br/>
**Act I : Inception**<br/>
The tale begins at the Prime's court,<br/>
The man a minister, the proceedings he wrote.<br/>
A vanquished monk, better kept at bay,<br/>
Abandoned by the people, still came to the fray.<br/>
The monk a friend: a renowned edit,<br/>
Despised the man; for want of his credit.<br/>
But fate had in store a different turn,<br/>
An exciting journey - no one could discern,<br/>
So in fortune's end was his fate thrown,<br/>
As he left the court where his power could've grown,<br/>
Leaving a legacy in the streets, and the throne.<br/>
The condescending wizard was not yet pleased,<br/>
For the man in question still had to bleed.<br/><br/>
