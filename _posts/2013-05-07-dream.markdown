My mind was distraught,<br/>
For I ought not,<br/>
Sit on a balcony and dream,<br/><br/>
Though it wasn't right,<br/>
This beautiful sight,<br/>
Was more than a desperate dream.<br/><br/>
But I had to forget,<br/>
For time wouldn't let,<br/>
A shipwrecked traveller dream.<br/><br/>
But I had to return,<br/>
Since I had lessons to learn,<br/>
And fulfil other's dreams.<br/><br/>
