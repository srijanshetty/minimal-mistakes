This wasn't because we had diligent students who attended all classes, on the contrary Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur didn't have a mandatory attendance policy.<br/><br/>
And yet, the rumour mill didn't churn with the news of a 'mass bunk', until CSE Y11 did.<br/><br/>
It was the last class before spring break of 2013 and Professor Biswas was teaching us 'Abstract Algebra' (side note, it's still abstract for me). Ten minutes before the class, a student decides to pull off a legendary coup - he just needs to convince 10 students.<br/><br/>
The first seven students are easy to convince, it's the last three - the most studious of the lot which take the most time. But he prevails and convinces an entire class to 'mass bunk'.<br/><br/>
What happens in the following days is something unique - silence. No angry emails by the professor, no students asked to visit the professor's cabin. There isn't even a minor mention in the corridors of the Motwani building.<br/><br/>
Post spring-break as we enter Professor Biswas's class, there is an air of mystery.<br/><br/>
Professor Biswas enters the class in his usual style - a grey mane with Rayban aviators, all he needed was a leather jacket to be in an American movie about a renegade teacher. In a very anti-climactic fashion, he pounces straight to the board and starts teaching Chapter 14.<br/><br/>
This is when a general dread kicks in across the classroom - we were on Chapter 9. When a brave students points out this discrepancy to the professor, he casually mentions:<br/><br/>
"I finished chapters 9 to 14 in the previous class".<br/><br/>
"Also, I conducted a quiz. Students can collect their answer sheets from my cabin later in the day"<br/><br/>
It's time for the students to remain silent. Shell shocked, Professor Biswas had the last laugh.<br/><br/>
We learnt a valuable lesson, you don't mess with professors, especially the professors at IIT Kanpur.<br/><br/>
