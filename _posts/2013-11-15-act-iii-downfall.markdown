And then came winter with a war in store,<br/>
A battle for power, of blood and gore.<br/>
Unaware, our man and his best,<br/>
were caught in action, put through a test,<br/>
A valiant general, an old friend,<br/>
A Nobel heart, with a mission to mend,<br/>
Seeked council, and honest advice,<br/>
As he sparred with a cunning vice;<br/>
A crooked heart, a master of deceit,<br/>
A worthy opponent, a man to beat.<br/>
Fuelled more by emotion, less by insight.<br/>
Our man, a fool, thought that he might<br/>
aid the general, show the people light.<br/>
But all went astray, when another front<br/>
a brother in arms, pulled a blinder - a stunt;<br/>
never did a councilman come to war.<br/>
He should've know - this would scar,<br/>
all he had, his council, his men,<br/>
alas! he could only wait; when.<br/>
If only, he hadn't been so brave,<br/>
If only, he hadn't erred so grave.<br/>
Two honourable men, two close friends,<br/>
Three men, battling for different ends.<br/>
Knowing all too well our man resigned -<br/>
power could corrupt, any pious mind.<br/>
Our man didn't lose much, he lost a lot.<br/>
The vice would fight fair - or so he thought,<br/>
The gullible general, his army bribed,<br/>
An unwinnable fight, with men who lied.<br/>
The councilman won a battle or two,<br/>
But in the end that proved too few,<br/>
The general lost, the councilman was defaced,<br/>
Both wallowed in pity as the vice embraced<br/>
the throne he craved. But to all's surprise,<br/>
In a public hearing, the cunning vice,<br/>
Sentenced the men, they were exiled,<br/>
Their glories, their victories all defiled.<br/>
