Amidst voices of other forlorn men,<br/>
An eerie silence, and a broken pen;<br/>
reminiscing, a man stood lost again.<br/>
A promise once made was broken;<br/>
the empty doorways stood it's token.<br/><br/>
I never feared what lay ahead,<br/>
but what was once - the buried dead,<br/>
a haunted past, a scarred child,<br/>
who stood there, hopeful, in the wild.<br/>
And when I looked into those eyes,<br/>
I felt a chill; I could hear the lies,<br/>
which were told to this innocent life -<br/>
promises of no struggle, no strife.<br/><br/>
Hollow words, just like mine.<br/>
But he endured he didn't whine,<br/>
Thinking, he could change time.<br/>
Alas, he was thrown into an abyss,<br/>
ambition was lost and so was his<br/>
faith. An innocent was lost to the man<br/>
he became, it wasn't how but was when -<br/>
the child became the man he despised.<br/>
