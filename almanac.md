## Books
I've only recently started tracking the books which I've read or I intend to read; and through this endeavour, I've come to the arguably depressing conclusion that I don't read as much I'd like to. I've decided not to burden myself with realization and find solace in the fact that I consume a lot of blogs daily.

## Talks
Those 'Aha' talks:

- [The UNIX Chainsaw - Gary Bernhardt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQnyApKysg4)
- [NoSQL - Martin Fowler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI_g07C_Q5I)
- [Practical Funcitional Programming - Pick Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcS-LdEBUkE)
- [The Tar Pipe](http://blog.extracheese.org/2010/05/the-tar-pipe.html)
- Any of Doughlas Crockford's Videos

## Music

## Software
I was introduced to the world of open source in college and I've never looked back.
Here's a list of some tools I can't live without:
