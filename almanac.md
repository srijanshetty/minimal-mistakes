## Software
I was introduced to the world of open source in college and I've never looked back.
Here's a list of some tools I can't live without:

- [alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty): a better terminal
- [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher): fast code search tool.
- [cli-goodes](https://github.com/srijanshetty/cli-goodies.git): misc tools for daily use.
- [fasd](https://github.com/clvv/fasd): use substrings and frecency to cd into folders.
- [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/): privacy first browsing..
- [foliate](https://johnfactotum.github.io/foliate/): clean ebook reader.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): fuzzy completion everywhere.

**Media organization**<br/><br/>
I'm an obsessive compulsive, and I've dedicated my life to sorting my <strike>shit</strike>  media.

- [anki](http://ankisrs.net/): powerful, intelligent flashcards.
- [inoreader](http://inoreader.com/): it's in vogue for now.

- git: as Torvalds says *source control as the way it should be*.
- [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/srijanshetty): pathetic, but it's all we've got.
- [google photos](https://photos.google.com): Google scored a homerun with this one.
- [google keep](https://keep.google.com): it's simple and works everywhere for tasks.
- [tasker](https://tasker.joaoapps.com): automate your phone.
 
**Privacy**<br/><br/>
There are trade-offs in privacy and I'm trying to be cognizant of each trade-off I make.

  - [decentraleyes](https://decentraleyes.org): local CDN.
  - [ublock origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock): a very powerful ad-blocker, saves battery, memory and _much more_.
