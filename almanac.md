## Books
I've only recently started tracking the books which I've read or I intend to read; and through this endeavour, I've come to the arguably depressing conclusion that I don't read as much I'd like to. I've decided not to burden myself with realization and find solace in the fact that I consume a lot of blogs daily.

## Music
[LastFM](www.last.fm/user/srijanshetty/tracks)

I read RSS on Digg (for-it-matters-which-RSS-reader-you-use).

## Software
I was introduced to the world of open source in college and I've never looked back.
Here's a list of some tools I can't live without:

- [antigen-hs](https://github.com/srijanshetty/antigen-hs): as git-submodules are a nightmare.
- [tmux](https://github.com/srijanshetty/vcsh-tmux): terminal multiplexer.
- [vcsh and mr](/technical/vcsh-mr-dotfiles-nirvana/): dotfiles nirvana.
- [vim](https://github.com/srijanshetty/vim-plug/): cause every other editor feels half baked.

**Media organization**<br/><br/>
I'm an obsessive compulsive, and I've dedicated my life to sorting my <strike>shit</strike>  media.

- [anki](http://ankisrs.net/): powerful, intelligent flashcards.
