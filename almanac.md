## Software
I was introduced to the world of open source in college and I've never looked back.
Here's a list of some tools I can't live without:

- [alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty): a better terminal
- [cli-goodes](https://github.com/srijanshetty/cli-goodies.git): misc tools for daily use.
- [fasd](https://github.com/clvv/fasd): use substrings and frecency to cd into folders.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): fuzzy completion everywhere.
- [tmux](https://github.com/srijanshetty/vcsh-tmux): terminal multiplexer.
- [vcsh and mr](/technical/vcsh-mr-dotfiles-nirvana/): dotfiles nirvana.
- [vim](https://github.com/srijanshetty/vim-plug/): no editor compares.
- [zsh](https://github.com/srijanshetty/zsh): instantly awesome ZSH using [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto).
- [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/): PDF Viewer.

**Media organization**<br/><br/>
I'm an obsessive compulsive, and I've dedicated my life to sorting my <strike>shit</strike>  media.

- [anki](http://ankisrs.net/): powerful, intelligent flashcards.
- git: as Torvalds says *source control as the way it should be*.
- [feedly](http://feedly.com/): it's in vogue for now.
- [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/srijanshetty): pathetic, but it's all we've got.
- [google photos](https://photos.google.com): Google scored a homerun with this one.
- [tasker](https://tasker.joaoapps.com): automate your phone.
