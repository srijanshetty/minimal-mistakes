## Software
I was introduced to the world of open source in college and I've never looked back.
Here's a list of some tools I can't live without:

- [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher): fast code search tool.
- [cli-goodes](https://github.com/srijanshetty/cli-goodies.git): misc tools for daily use.
- [fasd](https://github.com/clvv/fasd): use substrings and frecency to cd into folders.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): fuzzy completion everywhere.
- [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/): password manager.
- [podman](https://podman.io/): use this over docker.
- [snips](https://github.com/srijanshetty/snips): better snippet management by _moi_.
- [tmux](https://github.com/srijanshetty/vcsh-tmux): terminal multiplexer.
- [vcsh and mr](/technical/vcsh-mr-dotfiles-nirvana/): dotfiles nirvana.
- [vim](https://github.com/srijanshetty/vim-plug/): no editor compares.
- [zsh](https://github.com/srijanshetty/zsh): instantly awesome ZSH using [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto).

**Media organization**<br/><br/>
I'm an obsessive compulsive, and I've dedicated my life to sorting my <strike>shit</strike>  media.

- [anki](http://ankisrs.net/): powerful, intelligent flashcards.
- [inoreader](http://inoreader.com/): it's in vogue for now.
- [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/?_hp=c): it works, might reconsider.
- git: as Torvalds says *source control as the way it should be*.
- [google photos](https://photos.google.com): Google scored a homerun with this one.
- [google keep](https://keep.google.com): it's simple and works everywhere for tasks.
 
**Privacy**<br/><br/>
There are trade-offs in privacy and I'm trying to be cognizant of each trade-off I make.

- [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/): privacy first browsing..
  - [https everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere): we're still way behind HTTPS adoption.
  - [clearURLs](https://gitlab.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls): avoid URL based tracking.
  - [decentraleyes](https://decentraleyes.org): local CDN.
  - [ublock origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock): a very powerful ad-blocker, saves battery, memory and _much more_.
- [migadu](https://www.migadu.com/): email server, love them for their simplicity.
- [mullad](https://mullvad.net/en/): fast VPN based on WireGuard.
- [ravio](https://raivo-otp.com/): Open source TOTP solution.
