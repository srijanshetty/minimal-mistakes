## Software
I was introduced to the world of open source in college and I've never looked back.
Here's a list of some tools I can't live without:

- [tmux](https://github.com/srijanshetty/vcsh-tmux): terminal multiplexer.
- [vcsh and mr](/technical/vcsh-mr-dotfiles-nirvana/): dotfiles nirvana.
- [vim](https://github.com/srijanshetty/vim-plug/): cause every other editor feels half baked.
- [zsh](https://github.com/srijanshetty/zsh): Instantly Awesome ZSH using [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto).

**Media organization**<br/><br/>
I'm an obsessive compulsive, and I've dedicated my life to sorting my <strike>shit</strike>  media.

- [anki](http://ankisrs.net/): powerful, intelligent flashcards.
- git: as Torvalds says *source control as the way it should be*.
- [google photos](https://photos.google.com): Google scored a homerun with this one.
- [walnut](http://www.getwalnut.com/): powerful, expense tracking app.
- [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/): PDF Viewer.

## Media

Until I make a better section, [Trakt.tv](http://trakt.tv/users/srijanshetty).

## Books
I've only recently started tracking the books on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/srijanshetty) which I've read or I intend to read; and through this endeavour, I've come to the arguably depressing conclusion that I don't read as much I'd like to. I've decided not to burden myself with realization and find solace in the fact that I consume a lot of blogs daily.<br><br>
**RSS**<br>
I read RSS on [Inoreader](http://inoreader.com/) (for-it-matters-which-RSS-reader-you-use).<br><br>
**Papers**<br>
[Research Papers](https://github.com/srijanshetty/papers), that I found to be insightful an eon ago.
